    The first filehas some performance issues.

    After analysis, I think the biggest problem is memory.
    During the search, because it is recursive, to reduce the complexity
    from exponential to subexponential, I need to store the results in a dictionary.
    However, as n gets bigger, the solution also gets subexponentially bigger. As a results,
    a lot of memory is taken up and GC takes alot of time.

    To remedy this, instead of storing the results, I'm going to store a result reconstructor,
    which stores the minimum amount of information required to reconstruct the result.

    After the search is finished, I only need to reconstruct the full table once

        return 1
    elseif k > n
        return count_num_solutions_(n,n,table)
    elseif k == 1
        #since in the body, only k-1 appears, so this is a valid terminating case fo k
        return 1
    elseif haskey(table,(n,k))
        return table[(n,k)]

    num_solution = 0

    Actually, after writing a function to test the number of solutions to the equation
    1*x_1+2*x_2+3*x_3...n*x_n=n

    The number of non-negative solutions is 14779002588763

    The previous approach is beyond unrealistic.
    Need to actually solve this mathematically.
